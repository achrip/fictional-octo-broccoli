Introduction

Language models (LMs) have undergone a remarkable transformation in recent
years. Once limited to basic tasks like sentiment analysis, they can now tackle
complex challenges like answering in-depth questions \cite{stelmakh-etal-2022-asqa,fan-etal-2019-eli5}, generating
summaries of open-ended topics \cite{cohen-etal-2021-wikisum,giorgi-etal-2023-open,hayashi-etal-2021-wikiasp}, and reasoning through chains of
thought \cite{hendrycks-etal-2020-measuring,ho-etal-2020-constructing,wei-etal-2022-chain,geva-etal-2021-aristotle}. This progress has fueled a surge of applications
across various domains, including law. In the legal field, LMs are used for
tasks such as summarizing court rulings \cite{pont2023legal} and aiding in online dispute
resolution [12].

While LLM applications are growing within the legal domain overall, their use
with Indonesian law remains limited. The financial auditing body of Indonesia
maintains a web portal that provides access to government-issued statutes \cite{}.
We see this as an opportunity to leverage LMs for interacting with and
analyzing these Indonesian legal documents.

In this paper, We propose a generative model capable of answering specific questions
related to statutory law, particularly Indonesia's Non-Convention Vessel
Standards. The model leverages a retriever that searches the corpus of statutes
to find relevant legislative articles. This retrieved information is then used
by the generative model to formulate a comprehensive answer. This 
approach, known as the "retrieve-then-read" pipeline, forms the foundation of
our proposed solution.

Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have opened exciting
possibilities for using language models in various legal tasks around the
world. These models can summarize court decisions, analyze legal documents,
facilitate online dispute resolution, and even automate legal document creation
(e.g., Cohen et al., 2021; Westermann et al., 2023). This demonstrates the
potential of language models to revolutionize legal practices by automating
routine tasks and making legal information more accessible.

One powerful approach in NLP, particularly for legal text analysis, is the
"retrieve-then-read" pipeline. This method combines retriever and generative
models. Retriever models sift through massive legal text collections to find
relevant legislative articles and case law based on specific legal queries (Fan
et al., 2019; Hendrycks et al., 2020). This allows researchers and legal
professionals to effectively target their research or legal tasks.

However, adapting language models to the intricacies of legal domains like
Indonesian law presents unique challenges. Legal language requires a deep
understanding of complex terminology and nuanced variations in meaning, unlike
general-purpose language. Additionally, ensuring ethical and unbiased
application in legal decision-making is crucial.  Studies show that fine-tuning
language models on legal datasets significantly improves their accuracy and
relevance in legal tasks (Geva et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2022).

The effectiveness of language models in legal contexts is heavily influenced by
technical aspects like model architecture, fine-tuning techniques, and
evaluation metrics. Pre-trained models like BERT and GPT can be further refined
using legal corpora to improve performance in tasks like legal information
retrieval and question answering. Commonly used metrics to assess the accuracy
and reliability of language model outputs in legal text analysis include
precision, recall, and F1-score (Hayashi et al., 2021).

Developing effective language model solutions for Indonesian law requires
access to a comprehensive collection of legal documents (statutory corpus).
Platforms provided by government bodies and legal institutions offer vast
collections of statutes and legal documents. Retrieval techniques like keyword
searching, semantic similarity algorithms, and document clustering are used to
efficiently find relevant legal texts. These techniques form the foundation for
implementing the "retrieve-then-read" pipeline approach in the Indonesian legal
context.

While there's growing interest in applying NLP techniques to Indonesian legal
texts, significant research gaps remain. Previous studies have primarily
focused on basic text analysis tasks rather than advanced legal reasoning or
comprehensive document summarization specific to Indonesian law. Bridging these
gaps requires innovative approaches that combine advanced NLP techniques with
deep legal expertise to extract accurate and contextually relevant insights
from Indonesian legal documents.
